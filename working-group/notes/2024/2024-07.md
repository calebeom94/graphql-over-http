- Action item: Talking to Apollo about persisted operations
  - Jovi: Biggest issue were the set identifiers
  - Jovi: They were also keen on moving away from extensions
- Persisted operations identifier syntax (Martin)
  - Martin: Persisted documents, commented on the PR from Benjie for a formal
    syntax for the operation identifiers
  - Martin: follow-up PR
    [https://github.com/graphql/graphql-over-http/pull/296](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-over-http/pull/296)
  - Martin: Big question, should we restrict the characters to alphanumeric,...?
  - Martin: started with allowing everything, after a comment from Benjie
    restricted it more.
  - Martin: It’s always easier to relax rather than restrict the syntax
  - Martin: currently it’s restrictive allowing for URL-safe base64, checksums
    and guid
  - Martin: Does anyone need something else that is not captured in the PR?
  - Shane: Why forego an existing spec, i.e. using a smiley face in wikipedia
    encodes well as well
  - Benjie: as Martin said, it’s easier to relax than restrict - if there’s no
    solid use case for enabling additional characters we shouldn’t do so.
  - Benjie: the only missing one is allowing additional colons
  - Benjie: point to the RFC as copied it, non-normative
  - Benjie: I am in favor of this proposal
- Persisted operations
  - Benjie: A change to /graphql/&lt;hash>/&lt;operation-name>
  - Benjie: traditional tooling can understand the format more
  - Benjie: the sub-path solution would solve a lot of the common grievances
    with GraphQL like easier debugging,...
  - Jovi: we would need to highlight how to handle variables when i.e. URL gets
    too long
  - David: we have to ensure that clients that don’t go out of spec
  - David: I don’t love the concept of documentId in the JSON body
- Advancing the spec
  - Benjie: base spec excluding persisted operations is basically done and what
    everyone does anyway
  - Benjie: we should address security concerns, we have to be sensible as we
    don’t want to repeat the whole HTTP spec
  - Jovi: looking at prior art like gRPC they mention building on the HTTP/TLS
    spec
  - Shane: Things to explicitly note, Nature of GET vs POST and CORS
  - Samuel: being strict about content-type/…
  - Benjie: Good point, by saying that they _may_ use other encodings is
    stopping ourselves from using them in the future. Worth passing by Dennis
  - Benjie: There are a few encodings that I have used that aren’t in the spec
